## Hey 👋
I'm Eli 

I'm a final-year Computer Science student at Universidad de Alcalá and a former Solutions Architect Intern at AWS.

I am an AWS Certified Solutions Architect (Associate) & AI Practitioner, passionate about building scalable, data-driven cloud solutions.

🚀 I'm currently building my final year project: an end-to-end system to predict wildfire risk in Spain, deployed on an AWS Serverless architecture.

## About me
📚 I'm currently learning How to build end-to-end ML pipelines with XGBoost and AWS Serverless (for my final year project!) and Geospatial visualisation with Leaflet.js and advanced data engineering with Pandas.
🎲 Fun facts: I speak 4 languages! (Spanish, English, Akan, some French and I'm currently learning Mandarin HSK2).
When I'm not coding, I teach primary school students about climate science.
